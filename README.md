In this code, it is used for reference: GRCh38.p14 Human Genome Assembly, retrieved from NCBI.

The experiment was run on the first chromosome.

An Hidden Markov Model was assumed taking as transition probabilities the annotations of the genome.

In order to infer the most likely chain, the Viterbi algorithm was used; taking into account log probabilities in order to avoid underflow.

The result show the most likely chain of introns-exons in the first chromosome.

A limitation was the limited knowledge of genomics.
